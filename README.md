This contains my tasks from NIUS camp. This specially contains code to find chi-square fitting line for a problem to estimate the value of some physical quantities.

Here is a brief about my work:

| Experiment | Major Takeaways |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Finding **dipole moment** of a magnet by `Phyphox` app (using phone's magnetometer).<br>[Readings](mdipole.ipynb) | 1) Phone's magnetometer gets **saturated**, so it was necessary to rotate the phone in a figure-8 motion after some time.<br>2) The orientation of the magnet can be detected by rotating it 180Â° and checking if the sign of the field strength reverses. |
| Calculating **speed of sound** using Phyphox app (INPhO) <br>[Readings](vsound.ipynb) | Error due to least square fitting: when log cannot be taken. |
| Soft massive spring <br>[Readings](mass_spring.ipynb) | Non-uniformity in spring tends to **negative mass** correction term in static method. So rely on dynamic method. |
| Diffraction <br>[Readings](diffraction.ipynb) | If *a* when measured gives *a1 + da1*, *a2 + da2*, ..., *an + dan*, then report *a* as *avg(ai) + max(dai)*|
| Electronic Black Box <br>[Readings](ebb.ipynb) | In reverse bias, diode I-V characteristics resembles that of a resistor, but with resistance in the range of Mohm |

I learnt many more skills while performing the experiments, while will be difficult to comprehend here.
